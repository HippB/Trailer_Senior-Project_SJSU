Lawrence Adug, Javier Alonso Cardenas, Bryan Hui, Sagar Kanda	


The Trail-er companion robot is a cutting edge breakthrough designed in aiding those with mobility challenges, by allowing users to move freely without relying on assistance from others for carrying belongings or groceries, enhancing their sense of autonomy. The Trail-er is a specialized cart that comes equipped with bluetooth tracking intended to seamlessly track and follow its designated object. 
Currently there are many that suffer from physical limitations that struggle to perform basic tasks, one of those is lifting heavy objects, especially in required situations, in this case carrying groceries or their belongings. While lifting may not be the primary issue, the distance and length in which they have to carry their things can become an endeavor over long distances. Thus a solution to help alleviate these physical stresses is important as well as possibly very beneficial for everyday life.
Whether The Trail-er is assisting individuals with their daily tasks such as shopping or to provide support transporting heavy items. The Trail-er is made to provide mobility assistance in everyday life. Our companion robot will support individuals with their tasks by being a machine that will help carry some of the load. The end result of the product will be a compact and mobile companion designed to transport heavy loads in place of the user, thus resulting in less struggle and chance of injury overall.

Installation:
Controller App:
Navigate to the MIT app folder on the Github Repository. Select the car_control.apk and download the file onto the mobile device that will serve as the controller of The Trail-er device. Upon downloading, boot up the application for the first time and allow access for both Bluetooth and Location connectivity. Afterwards, power on your Trail-er device and pair the device on your phone's Bluetooth settings. Navigating back through the application, select the top-left most button, that will allow you to find and connect the app to the device. From there the user can decide to operate the device through the 4 movement buttons for forwards(up), backwards(down), left turn, and right turn; and the "o" serves as the submitter of your GPS signal for semi automatic control.

Device Code:
Connect your Trail-er device to a computer that has the Arduino IDE application installed. In the repository, select the Arduino code you would like to upload to the device. SeniorProjectFinalVersion.ino will be the program to upload for semi-automatic control. ManualControl.ino, will be the manual control program for the Trail-er. After deciding a version, compile and upload the code to the device, and after reconnecting the device to the battery pack and reseting the Arduino Uno board on the device, it is now ready for operation.
